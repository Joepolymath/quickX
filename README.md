# quickX
This is a text transfer software developed by me (Joshua Tobi Ajagbe).
It works by encoding the text into QR Codes, which could be decoded by any smart phone, thereby enabling a quick transfer of text from the user's PC to any smart phone.

I look forward to tweaking this software to enable the transfer of images. This hopefully will be achieved by converting the image matrices to qrCodes, which would further be decoded by a smart phone and converted back to a .jpeg file.

Looking forward to having contributors to join me in this quest.
